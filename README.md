# Manage-Lab-Sessions
The project consists in developping an application in order to manage lab sessions. The project idea actually comes from a real need of professors in order to be able to give marks to students using simply their smartphones or tablets. This application contains a mobile application (Portable on diffrent OSs) and also a web one in order to give the user the choice to use it from a computer. Used technologies : AngularJS, Bootstrap, Apache Cordova , Parse 

TO use Parse RESTful Webservice you need to create an application and get your application ID and application Key and add them to the "/js/properties.js" file.
